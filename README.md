# portfolio


My capstone project will be my portfolio. The portfolio will be animated with SVG animations. 
It will also include sections for projects, about me, and contact. 

MVP is the site laid out with flex or grid, made with React, including at least animations on logo and framework icons. 


<Wireframe Jpeg uploaded to repo/>

Details on the animations by section (reference wireframe): 

1. Top nav bar has menu that links to the different sections of the page
2. Top section with logo is the most animation heavy
1. On hover over the logo
1. (Potential) - Logo starts big as whole section, then on hover the animation sequence begins. Logo gets smaller, turns red, background flickers, lines start getting drawn down to the framework icons which get drawn in turn (like the monkey)
2. Lines draw down to the different framework icons
3. Spinning of the circle/color change on logo itself
4. Lightning bolts and background flicker to storm or night colors 
1. Could be SVG that starts off ALL white, then colors change on hover
5. Framework icons sway or jiggle or do SOMETHING on hover
3. Stuff I made section
1. The project tiles grow in size on hover, not modal, but grow
2. Project tiles link to the deployed projects
4. How to find me section, map grows on hover


Stretch goal - deploy on AWS!
